# Evo3D
Evolutionary deep attention convolutional neural networks for 2D and 3D medical image segmentation
This code is able to create a population of 3D evolutionary attention networks for meedical image segmentation (particularly Heart dataset for MRI heart segmentation; however, it can be used for any other dataset).


Main file is myfile_Evo3D_HEART.py

Required packages:
1) keras
2) numpy
3) matplotlib
4) skimage
5) random
6) math
7) tensorflow
8) pickle
9) functools
